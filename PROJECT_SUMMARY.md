# Project Summary: DWD Weather Data System

## 1. Project Overview

This project simulates a simplified data collection, storage, and retrieval system for the German Meteorological Service (DWD). It is designed to handle hourly temperature data from multiple weather stations across Germany. The data is stored in a central key-value store and can be accessed by various agencies for analysis and forecasting.

The system is composed of four main parts:
- **Stations:** Simulate weather stations that generate temperature data.
- **DataLoggers:** Poll the stations and send the data to the central server.
- **Key-Value Store (KVStore):** A central database that stores the temperature data.
- **Agencies:** Represent clients that read and process the data from the KVStore.

The project is designed to teach and demonstrate several key computer science concepts, including data structures, concurrency, fault tolerance, and object-oriented design.

## 2. Core Components and Architecture

The system follows a clear, object-oriented architecture with a separation of concerns between its components.

- **`Station.java`**: Represents a single weather station. It generates random temperature measurements and can simulate failures.

- **`DataLogger.java`**: Acts as a client that collects data from a `Station`. Each `DataLogger` runs in its own thread, continuously polling its assigned station for new data and writing it to the `KVStore`.

- **`KVStore.java`**: The central component of the system. It provides a thread-safe interface for storing and retrieving data. It uses a `Tree` (Binary Search Tree) as its underlying data structure.

- **`Tree.java`**: A Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation where each node represents a weather station, indexed by a unique `stationId`. Each node holds an `Entry` object containing the station's data.

- **`Entry.java`**: A simple data object that stores the `stationId` and a `LinkedList` of temperature values for that station. It also includes a method to calculate the average of the most recent readings.

- **`Agency.java`**: Simulates an external agency that needs to access the weather data. Each `Agency` runs in its own thread and periodically reads data from the `KVStore`.

- **`ReadWriteLockDWD.java`**: A wrapper for Java's `ReentrantReadWriteLock`. This custom lock is used in the `KVStore` to manage concurrent access.

## 3. Key Concepts Illustrated

### 3.1. Data Structures: Binary Search Tree (BST)

The `KVStore` uses a BST (`Tree.java`) to store station data. This choice of data structure has several implications:

- **Efficient Search:** A balanced BST provides O(log n) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations. This is crucial for a system with many stations.
- **Ordered Data:** The BST keeps the station IDs in a sorted order. This project cleverly uses this property for its fault-tolerance mechanism, where a `DataLogger` can query for the "parent" of a station in the tree, assuming that geographically close stations might have similar IDs and weather patterns.
- **Implementation:** The project required implementing `putTemperature`, `getTreeNode`, and `getParentNode` methods, giving students hands-on experience with BST traversal and manipulation.

### 3.2. Concurrency and Synchronization

This is a core theme of the project. The system has two types of threads running concurrently: `DataLogger` threads (writers) and `Agency` threads (readers).

- **The Problem:** Without proper synchronization, this could lead to race conditions. For example, an `Agency` might try to read data from a station while a `DataLogger` is in the middle of updating it, leading to inconsistent or corrupt data.

- **The Solution: Read-Write Locks:** The project uses a `ReadWriteLockDWD` to protect the `KVStore`. This is a more sophisticated and efficient solution than a simple mutex (a standard `lock`).
    - **Write Lock:** A `DataLogger` must acquire an exclusive **write lock** before it can add new data. This ensures that no other thread (reader or writer) can access the data structure during the update.
    - **Read Lock:** Multiple `Agency` threads can acquire a **read lock** simultaneously, as long as no thread holds the write lock. This allows for high-performance, concurrent reads, which is ideal for a system where data is read more frequently than it is written.

Students learn why this specific type of lock is well-suited for "many readers, few writers" scenarios, which are common in real-world systems.

### 3.3. Fault Tolerance

The project introduces a basic form of fault tolerance.

- **The Scenario:** A `Station` can fail, meaning it stops providing valid temperature readings.
- **The Solution:** When a `DataLogger` detects a failure, it doesn't just stop. Instead, it queries the `KVStore` for the most recent data from the "parent" of the failing station in the BST. It then logs this "borrowed" value for the failing station.
- **The Lesson:** This demonstrates a simple but powerful principle of fault-tolerant design: when a component fails, the system can use redundant or related data to continue operating, albeit in a degraded mode.

### 3.4. Object-Oriented Design

The project is a good example of object-oriented principles:

- **Encapsulation:** The `KVStore` encapsulates the `Tree` data structure and the `ReadWriteLockDWD`, hiding the complexity of the data storage and synchronization from the client threads (`DataLogger` and `Agency`).
- **Abstraction:** The `KVStore` provides a simple, high-level API (`putTemperature`, `getAverage`) that is easy for the clients to use.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each class has a well-defined responsibility, making the system easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

## 4. Conclusion

This project provides a practical and engaging way to learn about fundamental computer science concepts. By building a simulated real-world system, students can see the interplay between data structures, concurrency, and system design. The key takeaways are the importance of choosing the right data structure for the job, the necessity of synchronization in concurrent systems, and the value of designing for fault tolerance.
